Homework for week 5

Creating a workday planner for a client. Using time blocks to display the current hour, future hours and past hours to organize meetings and notes. We were tasked with displaying the current day at the top of the planner and having time blocks for work hours (9a-5p). The time blocks need to be able to receive text and save when the page is refreshed or closed and reopened.
