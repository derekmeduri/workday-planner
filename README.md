# workday-planner

Homework for week 5

Creating a workday planner for a client. Using time blocks to display the current hour, future hours and past hours to organize meetings and notes. We were tasked with displaying the current day at the top of the planner and having time blocks for work hours (9a-5p). The time blocks need to be able to receive text and save when the page is refreshed or closed and reopened. The time blocks background color should update depening on the current time. If time is in the past the block should be gray, if the time block is still in the future the background should be green and the current hour should have a red background.
